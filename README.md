# MakeFunWithList
According to the exercises from <a href="https://www.cp.eng.chula.ac.th/~piak/teaching/dsys/2017/rec-programming.htm" target="_blank">"Recursive Programming with List: A gentle and fun introduction"</a> by Prof. Prabhas Chongstitvatana, Ph.D. I did these exercises by C programming using Prof. Prabhas' owned list library.
However, I really did only 5 from 6 exercises.
