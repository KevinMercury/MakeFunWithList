# MakeFunWithList
<p>According to the exercises from <a href="https://www.cp.eng.chula.ac.th/~piak/teaching/dsys/2017/rec-programming.htm">Recursive Programming with List: A gentle and fun introduction</a> by Prof. Prabhas Chongstitvatana, Ph.D. I did these exercises by C programming using Prof. Prabhas' owned list library.</p>
<p>However, I really did only 5 from 6 exercises.</p>
<h2>How to use it (Mac)</h2>
<ol>
<li>Compiling exercise.c and ailib.c using C compiler. I used gcc by using <strong>gcc -c "input" -o "output"</strong> for each files.</li>
<li>Linking both output files from 1. to become the only one executeable file. I also used gcc by using <strong>gcc exercise.o ailib.o -o myapp</strong></li>
<li>Opening myapp to enjoy!</li>
</ol>
